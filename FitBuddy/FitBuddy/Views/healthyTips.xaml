 Body Mass Index (BMI)  is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square  of height in meters.
  A  high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness.
 BMI can be used to screen for weight  categories that may lead to health problems but it is not  diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual."

            <Label Text=" To loose weight you can slash calories but to lose fat, it's always a much slower process – and one best addressed through both diet and exercise.
  Aim for a mixture of compound exercises (squats, lunges, press ups), isolation exercises (hamstring curls, leg extensions, lateral raises) and a bit of cardio.
  Ultimately, the more muscle you have, the faster you'll burn fat, and the more time you spend working out at around 75% of your maximum heart rate,
the greater the after-burn effect – which basically means the longer you'll be burning calories after you've left the gym."

            <Label Text="  High-fiber carbs are a good choice because they can help you lose body fat while improving your digestion and cholesterol numbers.
You can look for low-fat, low-sugar 'dessert' type foods, including those that use stevia. And to keep a plan like this from becoming too bland, use seasonings.
They add very few calories to your meal. The key here is to not go above your daily calorie allotment. Having said that, it is common to 'zigzag' calorie totals. 
If you have a daily calorie allotment of 2,200, you can consume 1,800 one day, 2,400 the next, 1,950 the day after—as long as you're averaging 2,200 over the course of the week.
  As for cheat days or meals, I personally would rather have a healthy eating plan I can stick with than to go nuts one day a week and eat like a pig.
Not to mention that once you cheat it's hard to return to a strict diet the next day."
